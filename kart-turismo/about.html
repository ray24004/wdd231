                <h2>What is Kart Turismo Colombo?</h2>
                <p>Kart Turismo Colombo is a digital kart racing game that recreates the real-world map of Colombo, Brazil. The game promotes local tourism and businesses while delivering an engaging experience to players.</p>

                <h2>Our Mission</h2>
                <p>We strive to boost Colombo's tourism and economy by creating an interactive game that highlights the city's attractions and businesses. Through in-game incentives, players are encouraged to visit real locations and engage with local establishments.</p>

                <h2>The Vision Behind the Project</h2>
                <p>Colombo is often perceived as a "dormitory city" due to its residents commuting to Curitiba. Many of its historical and cultural sites remain underappreciated. This project seeks to change that by raising awareness and fostering engagement through an immersive digital experience.</p>
